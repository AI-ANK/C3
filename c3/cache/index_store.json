When determining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece (1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the mailpiece (see 601.3.3). 2.5Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces Flat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are considered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable parcel prices. 3.0Physical Standards for Parcels 3.1Processing Categories USPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: machinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.
